# curiousCopyCat

## About
CuriousCat is a Q&A site. Unfortunately, you cannot simply save the page or print to pdf since the posts load dynamically. `curiousCopyCat` uses the api to store all posts in a json file. 

## How to Use
Change the username in the last line, then run the file with node.

## Post Data
Line 7 of `script.js` filters each post to just the id, timestamp, question, answer, and attachments.
